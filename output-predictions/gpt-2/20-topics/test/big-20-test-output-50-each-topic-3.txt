<START>jackson 5; if you can make it up to me, don't you think that this could be the beginning for me?  i've seen a lot of them, but when did you realize that there wasnít something better than the way you had done before you even came on and left? what happened was your mistake (i won't mention where we went wrong) and now you and me both have been through hell and the highs, lows with some pretty good old-fashioned love (you know what you got) and maybe sometimes things get crazy then they get real (there are some good old-fashioned love) oh no, hey hey, yeah, yeah!  i just wanna tell the story i want all those tears to end right here let's see how far from perfect we can go tonight night in hollywood  so call me, say that you can make it up to me, don't you think that this could really turn you over or that itís only about my baby (baby, whoa) and boy (whoa)  do you think that you can make it up to me, don't you think that this could be "cause of you" or that itís only about us (thatís only us)  well, wait till we're together again 'cause i'm gonna try to take you back home at least as much you can put yourself into me (yeah, yeah) and everybody is entitled to their own opinions nobody should stop trying if itís not too big  ooh (whoa), come and bring me down tomorrow mama i'll try hard to give you everything time i ever need  every time we meet i feel like we touch we're almost there.  it feels like a hurricane hitting the coast we're falling below our feet and moving beneath our feet because everybodyís dancing to one another 'til they break.  so, why do the people who want this more look in their eyes instead start screaming louder 'no more i'm gonna show you what you can do' i'll teach you what you can learn will lead to you being successful next time around, yes i am.  cause we've both got the answers and we both know where we can go today and i believe it has to change once again until somebody comes closer to telling us nothing matters anymore unless they prove they were wrong sooner and surely without any signs of life ain't fairytale no longer fairytake, true  we're still going<END>
