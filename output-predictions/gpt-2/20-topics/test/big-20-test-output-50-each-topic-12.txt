<START>ashanti; written by karameta kunasugu wa (chorus)  my love for you will live forever in a land of mystery and wonder, it's all i really need.  when the moonlight shines above me your kisses leave this earth behind so that our lives may never end...  when its too late we're nearly at an ending time let 'em go and let us be saved from ourselves the way we felt before when we parted ways now  i wish to thank god for all he has for there was no one but myself, so if he gave his all i would weep over every single day for all he had for just one reason why oh...  when the sun sets into motion like fire i'm lost inside nothing else can ever come between us they say yes their hearts are made through everything i know about them how much we share  when the light goes down its almost impossible not knowing what to do cause when sunlight goes down its almost inconceivable not knowing what to believe cause when we close the door it's very easy on both sides.  when the midnight hour comes around every man dreams is here waiting for a chance to shine i wish some men could meet just as soon though they feel the stingiest days ahead of life  when the clock runs striking seven its quite meaningless meaning must have changed since then we're dangerously close together with only two words left to speak.  when the hour calls home everybody seems ready except nobody seems to understand the world's deepest sea yet we still don't seem capable unless we start to worry.  when the morning comes calling home everyone seems ready except nobody seems anymore to understand the world feels deep beneath ours where we belong.  when the sky doesn' dim bright sunshine shines brightly within our cities lights make me dance and sing we'll see each other soon enough along until we find ourselves alone again. when the evening comes knocking knockin' wood we're almost alone again caught up again caught up again caught up again caught up again caught up again caught up again caught up again caught up more caught up again caught up again caught up again caught up catch hold tight baby you got stuck holding me tight baby you gotta get yourself out tonight keep on shaking till the wee hours after noon.... please don`t hesitate give those loving people all the money that they've been searching hard times to find! when it gets tough on ya it makes sense to you realize the pain yeah and sometimes it gets hard trying - it feels alright, yeah<END>
