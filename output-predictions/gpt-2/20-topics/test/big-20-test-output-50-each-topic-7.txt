I'll show ya friend whats really happening through thier words everyday while holding hands deep within myself call'd upon ta learn whatever life brings until end times turn into death once thought comes clear nothing lasts longer hide under rocks throw stones run aground shoot darts everywhere use lightning strikes against enemy fire fly crazy fast break windows kill people drive big trucks keep burning stuff alive send missiles flying straight past walls burn bridges cut streets shut doors open shop street lights shine bright sunlight rain clouds dance hard sleep soundly sunnah lighten car cars touch tracks sing songs live music play cello tune song lines change colors find ways onto land walk along beach waterfalls rock formations dig tunnels dug underground move across paths lead young children running headlong trails climb stairs jump rope ladder lift buildings soar vertical cliffs fill rivers gorge trees grow green hills fall roots hold flowers tree shoots lay dead leafless leaves cover forests flower grove gather<END>
