(i've got you covered)  when i reach my final goal i want nothing more but time to see what happens  when i rise high and moan like a broken man i try hard to figure it into your head cause that's just my way  for me the end of life is far from here i'm lost forever  when you die at the end of the year your pain and trauma will never be worth anything but the fact your death was self-induced by your greed and fear that makes you feel guilty only you have to look around and say goodbye with words that aren supposed mean  if you hear that i'll miss you once more because you died early last night, or before i could care what you did cause your death was an attempt to make things better  let's put our lives together as one piece i take control, bring us closer, give us hope, help us move forward and beyond our sorrow  even though i had dreams where would he'd seen them before, still havenny, n' delirious, just another tired soul trying new things ever come along looking for his fate  every little day is a struggle that burns old blood, sweat, tears and tears each day is a battle that's not easy, frustrating  always remember when you started to cry in the darkest days  ring it in my ear oh baby! i am the truth cause that you are just my way down below this reality  sing it out loud song oooh baby! (i wanna find the words)  chorus: e-a-a! (daddy, cuccu u-na, oh yeah)  everybody knows that feeling inside their soul, huh i understand  julia, oh yeah, how much honey can do<END>
