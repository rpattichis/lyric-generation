love & happiness - good times/bad moments between two worlds / yesterday only yesterday before tonight [tears] came through loudness downwind as usual rain clouds cut across blue sky while darkness kept shining around sunsets light up green leaves inside trees give-a kiss till daybreak keep telling yourself ooooayyyy look over those little white flowers how lovely honeymy eyes glow bright reds shine under sunlight making stars bloom everywhere wanna hold some fun things away dear missus: dont put pressure though make sure nothing makes noise stop everything going crazy leave without taking anything apart watch lots kids play games show real carein', sometimes break into other houses ask questions asking myself who should sleep next door explain whats bothering nobody talktin'-to eachother hide hid behind walls talking stuff off camera shoot stories everyday take pictures hang photos write letters checkbooks send etext messages share movies listen lovingly cuz ditto feel free once got tired wear new clothes buy whatever jeans work fine use old fashioned handkerchief sipping wine makin songs fresh paintbrush kite blower fill shoes wash arms set aside food comforts such as water bottles cool phones easy ways music keeps falling fast lights turn cellphones blackedout car doors open windows hear voices coming closer calls knockers drive keys close shopies beat drums tune amps sing guitar riffs wackles runaways walkways running past trash cars chase dogs chasing men walking<END>
